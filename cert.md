Yes, you can implement HTTPS for `localhost` using a trusted certificate for local development, though this requires a few extra steps. You can either:

1. **Continue using a self-signed certificate** (with the warning bypassed).
2. **Create your own certificate and trust it in your local machine**.
3. **Use a tool like Let's Encrypt for local development**, though this is not the usual way (Let's Encrypt typically issues certificates for public domains, not `localhost`).

For local development, the most common solution is **option 2**, where you create your own certificate authority (CA), generate a certificate for `localhost`, and then trust the CA on your machine.

### Steps to Implement HTTPS with a Trusted Certificate for `localhost`

To get a fully trusted HTTPS connection on `localhost` without browser warnings, you can:

1. **Create your own Certificate Authority (CA)**.
2. **Generate a certificate for `localhost` signed by your own CA**.
3. **Trust your CA certificate on your local machine**.

Hereâ€™s how to do this:

---

### Step 1: Create a Certificate Authority (CA)

You will first create a root certificate that acts as your certificate authority (CA).

1. Open a terminal and generate a private key for your CA:

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out myCA.key 2048
   ```

2. Create a self-signed root certificate (CA certificate):

   ```bash
   openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key myCA.key -sha256 -days 1024 -out myCA.pem
   ```

   You will be prompted to enter some information, such as country, state, organization, etc. These values can be arbitrary for local development.

### Step 2: Create a Certificate for `localhost`

1. Create a private key for `localhost`:

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out localhost.key 2048
   ```

2. Create a certificate signing request (CSR) for `localhost`:

   ```bash
   openssl req -new -key localhost.key -out localhost.csr
   ```

   When prompted for the "Common Name (CN)," enter `localhost`.

3. Create a configuration file for the certificate extensions (`localhost.ext`) with the following content:

   ```ini
   authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
   basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
   keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyEncipherment, dataEncipherment
   subjectAltName = @alt_names

   [alt_names]
   DNS.1 = localhost
   ```

4. Generate a certificate for `localhost` signed by your CA:

   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -in localhost.csr -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial -out localhost.crt -days 500 -sha256 -extfile localhost.ext
   ```

---

### Step 3: Trust the Certificate on Your Local Machine

#### For macOS:

1. Open **Keychain Access**.
2. Import `myCA.pem` (the CA certificate) by going to **File > Import Items**.
3. Find `myCA` in the **Certificates** section under **System** or **login** keychain.
4. Double-click the certificate, expand **Trust**, and set **"When using this certificate"** to **"Always Trust"**.

---

### Step 4: Configure Spring Boot to Use the Certificate

Once the certificate for `localhost` is created, configure Spring Boot to use it.

1. Convert the `.crt` and `.key` files to a `.p12` keystore:

   ```bash
   openssl pkcs12 -export -out keystore.p12 -inkey localhost.key -in localhost.crt -certfile myCA.pem
   ```

2. Update your `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

   ```properties
   server.port=8443
   server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
   server.ssl.key-store-password=your_password
   server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
   server.ssl.key-alias=1
   ```

---

### Step 5: Access Your Application via HTTPS

Now, when you access `https://localhost:8443`, your browser should trust the certificate, and you will no longer see warnings about an insecure connection.

### Recap:

- **Create your own CA** and a certificate for `localhost`.
- **Trust the CA certificate** in your operating system.
- **Configure Spring Boot** to use the certificate.
- **Access `https://localhost:8443`** without warnings.

This process will ensure that HTTPS works locally with a trusted certificate for `localhost`.
